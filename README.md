# RestAssuredDemo

## Objective
This initiative aims to motivate and introduce people who do not know how to test an API rest, who have never had an approach to it or simply who do not have the time to consult on the subject. This topic is transversal to each discipline since it can be of interest to anyone, if it is a developer, tester or even a student, because this knowledge can be applied in their projects and thus achieve better quality software.â€‹
